Spectre and Meltdown mitigation detection tool v0.37+

Checking for vulnerabilities on current system
Kernel is Linux 4.1.15-gebf27f8-dirty #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Jun 3 17:49:22 IST 2018 armv7l
CPU is ARM v7 model 0xc09
We're missing some kernel info (see -v), accuracy might be reduced

Hardware check
* CPU vulnerability to the speculative execution attack variants
  * Vulnerable to Variant 1:  YES 
  * Vulnerable to Variant 2:  YES 
  * Vulnerable to Variant 3:  NO 
  * Vulnerable to Variant 3a:  NO 
  * Vulnerable to Variant 4:  NO 

CVE-2017-5753 [bounds check bypass] aka 'Spectre Variant 1'
* Kernel has array_index_mask_nospec (x86):  UNKNOWN  (couldn't check (couldn't find your kernel image in /boot, if you used netboot, this is normal))
* Kernel has the Red Hat/Ubuntu patch:  UNKNOWN  (couldn't check (couldn't find your kernel image in /boot, if you used netboot, this is normal))
* Kernel has mask_nospec64 (arm):  UNKNOWN  (couldn't check (couldn't find your kernel image in /boot, if you used netboot, this is normal))
* Checking count of LFENCE instructions following a jump in kernel...  UNKNOWN  (couldn't check (couldn't find your kernel image in /boot, if you used netboot, this is normal))
> STATUS:  UNKNOWN  (Couldn't find kernel image or tools missing to execute the checks)

> How to fix: Re-run this script with root privileges, after installing the missing tools indicated above

CVE-2017-5715 [branch target injection] aka 'Spectre Variant 2'
* Mitigation 1
  * Kernel is compiled with IBRS support:  NO 
    * IBRS enabled and active:  NO 
  * Kernel is compiled with IBPB support:  UNKNOWN  (in offline mode, we need the kernel image to be able to tell)
    * IBPB enabled and active:  NO 
* Mitigation 2
  * Kernel has branch predictor hardening (arm):  YES 
  * Kernel compiled with retpoline option:  NO 
> STATUS:  NOT VULNERABLE  (Branch predictor hardening mitigates the vulnerability)

CVE-2017-5754 [rogue data cache load] aka 'Meltdown' aka 'Variant 3'
* Kernel supports Page Table Isolation (PTI):  NO 
  * PTI enabled and active:  NO 
  * Reduced performance impact of PTI:  NO  (PCID/INVPCID not supported, performance impact of PTI will be significant)
* Running as a Xen PV DomU:  NO 
> STATUS:  NOT VULNERABLE  (your CPU vendor reported your CPU model as not vulnerable)

CVE-2018-3640 [rogue system register read] aka 'Variant 3a'
* CPU microcode mitigates the vulnerability:  NO 
> STATUS:  NOT VULNERABLE  (your CPU vendor reported your CPU model as not vulnerable)

CVE-2018-3639 [speculative store bypass] aka 'Variant 4'
* Kernel supports speculation store bypass:  NO 
> STATUS:  NOT VULNERABLE  (your CPU vendor reported your CPU model as not vulnerable)
