+	  Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors rely on
+	  being able to manipulate the branch predictor for a victim context by
+	  executing aliasing branches in the attacker context.  Such attacks
+	  can be partially mitigated against by clearing internal branch
+	  predictor state and limiting the prediction logic in some situations.
+
+	  This config option will take CPU-specific actions to harden the
+	  branch predictor against aliasing attacks and may rely on specific
+	  instruction sequences or control bits being set by the system
+	  firmware.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.
